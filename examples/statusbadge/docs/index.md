# Page Status Example

The example shows how to add a [page status] to a page. This works for
section index pages as well as 'normal' pages.

You can add the existing status identifiers `new`
and `deprecated` but also define custom ones by:

1. defining the tooltip in your `mkdocs.yml`
2. defining the icon to use in your `extra.css`
